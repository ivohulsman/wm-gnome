# i3wm / LeftWM + GNOME [![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2022.svg)]()

## ⚠️ Are you looking for your first contribution to Open Source?
We are looking for a new co-maintainer for this project. If you're a newcomer to Open Source we'll happily invite to help you get started.

This is the roadmap we have planned so far for this year:

- Welcome a new maintainer (specially if it's a newcomer).

- Improve the wiki. We can either set up a GitHub Page or improve the wiki section.

- Add packages for Fedora and Ubuntu. Currently, we have the AUR Arch Linux package.

If this sounds good to you then open an issue and on the title put: "I want to help on this project".

Allows you to use i3wm or LeftWM with GNOME 3 Session infrastructure.

## What do I get by installing it?
- A way to manage GNOME things such as your cursor/icon, (GTK) themes and online accounts.
- A friendly bridge that keeps your stuff from GNOME in an i3 or LeftWM environment.
- Useful for people that are getting started with i3wm or LeftWM, but don't want to uninstall their current desktop environment.
